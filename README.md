Classroom Manager: Organizes a classroom seating system through Java

This project helps create a classroom (represented by a 2D Array) in which you can add students to a specific seat within the class. The Student class helps set up details about
the student such as name and student ID. The seat class tells us what position the student can be seated in thanks to the methods in that same class. The classroom class has
methods that will help a classroom's details be set up (such as the name of the class, size of the class, and the room name). You can add students to the class and
assign seats to those students via the class's methods. I've showcased the methods being used in the main method, which is present in the classroom class.
